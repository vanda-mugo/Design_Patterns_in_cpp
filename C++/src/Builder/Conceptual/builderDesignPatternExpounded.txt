The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
 Here's a simple example in C++:

the main summary of the builder design pattern is as follows 

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. 
This pattern allows you to create different representations of an object by providing a step-by-step construction process.
 The key idea is to have a director class that orchestrates the construction using a builder interface,
  and concrete builder classes that implement the steps to construct different variations of the object.

Here are the main components involved in the Builder Design Pattern:

    Product:
        Represents the complex object to be constructed. It often has multiple parts or attributes.

    Builder:
        An abstract interface that declares the construction steps for building the product.
        Typically, a builder interface includes methods for building each part of the product.

    Concrete Builder:
        Implements the builder interface and provides concrete implementations for constructing different variations of the product.
        Each concrete builder knows how to build a specific version of the product.

    Director:
        Orchestrates the construction process using a builder. It doesn't know the specifics of how each part is constructed; it relies on the builder's interface.

Now, let's break down the process of using the Builder Design Pattern:

    Client Code:
        The client code creates a director and a builder object.
        It then passes the builder to the director.

    Director:
        The director uses the builder to construct the product.
        It calls the builder's methods to build each part of the product.

    Builder:
        The builder provides concrete implementations for building each part of the product.
        It returns the final product when the construction is complete.

    Product:
        The product is the complex object constructed by the builder.
        It can have different configurations based on the concrete builder used.






nb: the basic idea is to have a director class that orchestrates the building process using a builder interface and having 
concrete builders that basically implements this interface
